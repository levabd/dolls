<strong>RMH Lab Bottle 001.</strong><br>
<br>
A customisable laboratory bottle for washes, or any other operation that requires precise control over the flow of a liquid; the liquid inside the bottle can have its height scaled. The bottle is made up of the bottle body, liquid lower, liquid upper, tube, lid, and a nozzle (this allows the lid to turn along with the tube). The liquid material can be fully customised via Unity's Standard shader, and the materials whose albedo channels are in use can be tinted for different effects.<br><br>

The bottle also features 3 types of label (full, medium, small) -- these are separate objects, each using their own 0.5K texture (only the labels have separate textures; the all other pieces -- minus the liquid -- share one set of texture maps). As separate objects, they can be positioned wherever you like (as long as they match the bottle body's face angle / origin is at the bottle centre), and you can have as many labels on the bottle as will fit. In addition to this, the UV layout of the labels is such that you can create your own designs of label (for the albedo channel; all other channels are fixed; though, it is easy enough to create the other channels with free software [see the Unity documentation for more details]), and UV layout templates (PNGs) have been provided for each of the label sizes. The second YouTube video gives a quick demonstration of how to do this using the free software <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)</a>.<br><br>

<strong>Important Note: </strong>This asset uses Linear Color Space. To set this up in your scene, in Unity go to <strong>Edit >> Project Settings >> Player </strong>, then in the <strong>Other Settings</strong> section of the Inspector in the <strong>Color Space*</strong> drop-down menu, select <strong>Linear</strong>. Using other Color Space settings tends to make colours look washed-out / flat.
